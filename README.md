# arrEmbyScan
This uses PowerShell and Emby's API to run a library scan of a specific directory passed into the script by Sonarr or Radarr using the connect options. In my environment I use Sonarr, Radarr and Emby on two separate Windows devices. I do this mostly for compatibility with GPU hardware acceleration for transcoding.This can easily be modified to work with other operating systems as well.
